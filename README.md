# 🚀 **CI/CD Pipeline Setup on AWS EC2 with Jenkins, Docker, SonarQube, and Trivy**

## 📋 **Project Overview**

This repository provides a comprehensive setup and configuration for a CI/CD pipeline on an AWS EC2 instance using **Jenkins**, **Docker**, **SonarQube**, and **Trivy**. The pipeline automates the **continuous integration, testing, and delivery** of Java applications, offering a streamlined workflow for faster and reliable software delivery.

This solution integrates multiple DevOps tools to handle **build automation**, **code quality analysis**, **security vulnerability scanning**, and **application deployment**, with the flexibility to scale for real-world projects.

## 🛠 **Key Technologies Used**

- **💻 AWS EC2**: Ubuntu-based virtual server hosting Jenkins and other essential tools.
- **⚙️ Jenkins**: Core CI/CD automation server managing builds, tests, and deployments.
- **🐳 Docker**: Containerization platform ensuring consistency across environments.
- **🔍 SonarQube**: Continuous code quality inspection for detecting bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
- **🛡️ Trivy**: Security vulnerability scanner for Docker images.
- **📦 Maven**: Build automation tool for managing dependencies and compiling Java projects.

## ✨ **Project Highlights**

### ☁️ **Infrastructure on AWS**
- Hosted on a scalable **t2.medium EC2 instance** with **30 GB EBS storage** in **US-EAST-1** region.

### 🛠️ **Jenkins as CI/CD Engine**
- **Automates the CI/CD pipeline**, handling source code compilation, testing, and deployment.
- Integrated with SonarQube for **code quality analysis** and Trivy for **security scans**.

### 🔍 **SonarQube for Code Quality**
- SonarQube integrates seamlessly with Jenkins to provide **real-time insights** into code quality.
- Enforces coding standards and identifies **code duplication**, **bugs**, and **vulnerabilities**.

### 🛡️ **Security Scanning with Trivy**
- **Trivy** scans Docker images for **known vulnerabilities**, ensuring secure deployments.
- Integrated into Jenkins to trigger scans as part of the CI pipeline.

### 🐳 **Containerization with Docker**
- SonarQube and Trivy are deployed using **Docker containers**, offering portability and ease of management.
- Docker also facilitates a consistent and isolated environment for the **build and testing process**.

## 💡 **Usage and Benefits**

This pipeline setup is ideal for teams and developers aiming to:

- 🚀 **Implement** a complete CI/CD pipeline for **Java applications**.
- ✔️ **Ensure** consistent testing, code quality analysis, and security scanning before deployment.
- 🤖 **Automate** repetitive tasks such as running tests, checking code quality, and security scans.
- ☁️ **Leverage** AWS infrastructure for scalability and flexibility in deployment environments.

---

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

- 🌐 Integration with **Kubernetes** for container orchestration.
- 🏗️ Support for **multi-stage deployments** across different environments (e.g., staging, production).
- 🔄 Extend pipeline capabilities to support **multiple programming languages** and frameworks.
- 🔑 Add advanced security features like **image signing** and **runtime security scanning**.
